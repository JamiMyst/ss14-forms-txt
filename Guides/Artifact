Within the space of Research and Development, Xenoarcheology is a rich and complex field full of mysteries to be discovered - so it's good to know what all can happen. 
[head=3]What is an Artifact?[/head] 
An artifact is any sort of physical otherworldy object, and they vary wildly in size, shape, and effects. Artifacts have a series of Stimulus-Reaction pairs called Nodes, and they all fit into a small tree. Below is an example. 

Node 1 (Depth 0, Edges 4)
├Node 2 (Depth 1, Edges 1)
├Node 3 (Depth 1, Edges 1)
├Node 4 (Depth 1, Edges 3)
│├Node 5 (Depth 2, Edges 1)
│└Node 6 (Depth 2, Edges 1)
└Node 7 (Depth 1, Edges 1)

In this example you have a simple three-layer tree with a total of seven nodes; Seven possible and unique Stimulus-Reaction pairs.

To better understand artifact tree navigation, it is important to understand two common terms: 'Depth' and 'Edges'. Depth is the numerical representation of how far away you are from the base initial node - each artifact starts at Depth 0 (as seen with Node 1), may descend down or ascend up depending on the controls of the Artifact Analyzer Console. 'Edges' on the other hand represent the number of directly connected nodes from your current node - the number of possible paths we can travel down and up the tree from our current position. It is important to remember that your edge value always includes your return path up (with the sole exception of where depth is 0, as you cannot go any higher), so for most common applications the total number of possible destinations while descending is equal to our edge value minus 1.

Putting this example to use in our tree above, descending from node 1 will choose one of its four edges: node 2, node 3, node 4, or node 7. If we end up on nodes 2, 3, or 7 - we will have an edge value of 1, showing there are no further nodes to explore down this path. We can then go back up to node 1 to descend down again, until we have fully mapped out and explored our artifact tree.

With each unique node that we activate for the first time, we then can extract research from the artifact, which then will be stored within our R&D server. These points fuel our ability to develop new machines, tools, and services for our station, and improves the financial stock value of Nanotrasen for its shareholders.

Electricity
    Tap the artifact with a multitool, or anchor it over a powered wire.

High temperatures
    Hit it with an active welding tool.

Physical trauma
    Beat it up! Circular saws from robotics are a good weapon, though a crowbar works as well!

Tool usage
    Anchor it down with a wrench, and unanchor it.

Sonic vibrations
    Play a song near it, it'll enjoy it.

Hydro-reactive
    Pour or spray water on it.

Reaction with hematological fluid
    Pour or spray your blood on it.

Magnetic waves
    Equip a pair of magboots, and enable them.

Life essence
    Kill something near the artifact; monkeys, kobolds, or small pests are preferred by Nanotransen, through not strictly required.

Radiation
    Expose radiation to it; This could be from a Uranium spear, another artifact, a microwave if it's small enough, or a singularity if you're brave enough!
    
Extreme pressure
    A node where depth actually matters. If depth is less than or equal to 2, the artifact requires extremely LOW pressure - this is typically achieved by spacing the chamber, which most xenoarcheology bays are equipped to handle. If depth is greater than or equal to 3, the artifact requires extremely HIGH pressure - which can be achieved with an air injector. If your station is not equipped with the infrastructure to pump air into the chamber for high pressure, using a remote signaler with an igniter is a safe way to ignite plasma without burning yourself in the process - link the signaler and leave the igniter in the chamber, and slowly pump plasma in. Once ignited, the ideal gas law states that pressure will rise as temperature rises - all contained within the confines of your xenoarcheology bay!

Standard atmosphere gases
	Pump Carbon dioxide into the chamber.
    
Gaseous plasma
    Pump in some gas plasma, it's in a shiny red tank with a P on it.

Active deceleration*
    Throw the Artifact against as a wall.

Examination
    Just look at it, take a really close look.

Therapeutic chemicals
    Pour or spray medicine on it - coordinate with your local medical department for some Bicardine!

Cerebral influence
    A small message will appear, either warning or reassuring you.

Environmental disruption
   Might mend a few of your wounds - in reality it's probably going to blow up.

Electrical interference
   The power's gonna flicker a bit, and maybe a shutter will open.

Metaphysical displacement
   Get ready to play hide'n'seek with the artifact after it teleports.

Matter creation
   The artifact manifests a creature, object, or even an anomaly!

Energy consumption
   The room will get colder. Not very lizard friendly.

Energy release
   The room will get hotter. Not very Moff friendly.

Biochemical disruption
   A cloud of a random chemical will appear, often leaving a mess on the floor. Don't breathe too deep!

Station-wide destruction
   The artifact will spawn a volatile power orb, such as the Singularity or Tesla. Do not under any circumstances activate a node with this reaction.

Small entity accelerator*
    The artifact now permanently acts like a firearm.

Utility conglomerate*
    The artifact now permanently acts like multitool.

Internal chamber*
    The artifact now permanently acts like a beaker or cup.

Internal storage*
    The artifact now permanently acts like a bag.

Serrated rotator*
    The artifact now permanently acts like a drill. (Wrench + Screwdriver)

Lubricated surface*
    The artifact now permanently acts like a bar of soap.

Long-distance communication
    The artifact now permanently acts like an intercom.

Structural phasing
    The artifact now permanently will move through solid structures, and can no-longer be sold.

Neurological activity
    The artifact is now alive, and will talk and move around. (This is a ghost role.)

Transmogrificational activity
    Any nearby creatures will be turned into a random mob.

Magnetic waves
    Objects will now slowly orbit around the artifact. It can spin either direction.

Visual distortions
   The artifact will become invisible, only faintly still there.

*small, handheld artifacts only.
